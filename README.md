What does it do?

It unites the people and gives them a tool to fight against the enemies of humanity. Sometimes, harm caused by specific things have a catastrophic effect on the world.  Sometimes, these things can be clearly identified.  Sometimes, they are supported by those who hold power.  Sometimes, things hide in the shadows.  The things need to be identified and brought into the light at times.  The things, at times, need to be stopped.  Because sometimes, it is about survival.   

When enough people unite to fight for a cause, the tool will become active.  It will be a high hurdle.  It must be obvious and support must be nearly unanimous.  The power of the tool will grow with the support of the people.

Where A is Bad Actor
-> is the function of harm
Where B is the Weaker

A->B = -B Determines Reversal Goal (RG)

Where PF is Pitchforks
-B PF A = PFA

where n = number
where c = action organization
PF(A) + n = n(PF(A)) = PF(Value)
PF > RG = RG |-> -B
             |-> C
