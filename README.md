 Pitchforks Ecosystem
 Embracing Moral Techno-Economics for a Better Future
 Abstract
 The Pitchforks ecosystem represents a bold vision: merging moral philosophy with cutting-edge
 technology to create a decentralized future where innovation and ethics coexist. Through a series of
 interconnected projects-Goldengoat, Pitchforks, and GhostOS-we present a unified approach to
 addressing real-world challenges, incentivizing positive contributions, and building resilient,
 community-driven systems. This whitepaper outlines the principles, architecture, and tokenomics of
 our ecosystem.
 Philosophical Foundation
 Rooted in Plato's concept of justice-the interest of the weaker-the Pitchforks ecosystem builds a
 framework that emphasizes fairness and moral responsibility. Drawing from archetypes, the system
 introduces Ninjas (stealth and strategy) and Knights (honor and leadership) as metaphors for
 different roles. Horus, symbolizing vigilance and foresight, represents the platform's continuous
 watch for harmful actions.
 Pitchforks Functionality
 Pitchforks is designed to unite people and provide a tool to fight against harm to humanity. Harmful
 actions can sometimes be clearly identified and need to be addressed, especially when they are
 backed by powerful entities. Pitchforks works by setting a high hurdle for activation, ensuring
 legitimacy through community consensus. When support meets the required threshold, an
 organization is formed to carry out the mission.

 Mathematical Framework:
 A -> B = -B, where A represents the harmful act and B represents the weaker party affected by it.
 The goal is to determine a reversal goal (RG) that mobilizes the community to act against A.
 When PF > RG, where PF represents Pitchforks' level of support, the mission is activated.
 Tokenomics
 The Pitchforks ecosystem is powered by a native utility token called PFORK. This token facilitates
 governance, incentivizes positive behavior, and ensures sustainability across all projects.
 Token Name: Pitchforks Token (PFORK)
 Supply: Fixed supply of 10 million PFORK
 Utility includes Governance, Rewards, and Access.
 Networks: Active on NEO N3, NEO X, and Ethereum.
 Roadmap
 Phase 1: Launch of Goldengoat MVP (Q1 2025)
 Phase 2: Release of Pitchforks Beta (Q2 2025)
 Phase 3: Launch of GhostOS with integrated PFORK support (Q3 2025)
 Phase 4: Cross-chain compatibility and ecosystem scaling (Q4 2025)
 Team
 The Pitchforks ecosystem is led by a diverse group of innovators, developers, and philosophers who
 believe in the power of decentralized technology to shape a better world.
